## 2024-05-22 - Export Utilities Found **Discovery:** Found `utils/exportUtils.ts` containing `generateCsvExport` and `generateJsonBackup` functions that were underutilized. **Opportunity:** Easily implemented a "Export filtered view" feature in `TransactionMasterList` by connecting the filtered data state to this utility. This pattern can be replicated for other lists (e.g., Habits, ToDos).

## 2025-05-15 - Budget Calendar Enhancement **Discovery:** The `BudgetCalendar` modal lacked a date picker, forcing users to delete and recreate events to move them. It also lacked a way to duplicate recurring or one-off events. **Opportunity:** Adding a simple Date Picker and Duplicate button to the existing modal unlocks "Move Event" and "Clone as Template" workflows with minimal code.

## 2025-05-20 - Batch Transaction Management **Discovery:** Transaction management was strictly one-by-one, despite `FirebaseHouseholdContext` supporting atomic updates. Users importing bank statements (via CSV or AI) likely face a "cleanup debt" requiring bulk categorization. **Opportunity:** Implemented a "Batch Selection Mode" in `TransactionMasterList` using `Promise.allSettled` to execute parallel updates. This pattern unlocks bulk workflows for other lists like ToDos (Batch Complete) or Pantry (Batch Delete).

## 2025-06-03 - Habits CSV Export **Discovery:** The existing `generateCsvExport` utility in `utils/exportUtils.ts` is robust and easily reusable for other data models like Habits. **Opportunity:** Enabled "Export Habits" feature with <50 lines of code by transforming the `Habit[]` structure to flat objects, providing high user value (data portability) with minimal effort.

## 2026-01-17 - Unified Calendar Agenda **Discovery:** The `BudgetCalendar` component is the application's primary temporal view but was restricted to financial data, while `ToDos` lacked any calendar visualization. **Opportunity:** By injecting `todos` into the existing `BudgetCalendar` logic, we unlocked a "Daily Agenda" view that contextualizes tasks alongside financial events without creating a new page or complex component.

## 2026-01-17 - Meals Page Unification **Discovery:** The `MealsPage` lacked the Shopping List tab despite `ShoppingListTab` component being fully implemented and `AGENTS.md` describing it as part of the Meals system. **Opportunity:** Unified the Meals workflow by adding the missing Shopping List tab to `MealsPage`, creating a seamless Pantry -> Meal Plan -> Shopping List loop.

## 2026-02-18 - Batch Pantry Actions **Discovery:** Users scanning receipts often need to clear multiple items or restock in bulk, but the UI forced one-by-one actions. **Opportunity:** Implemented "Batch Selection Mode" in `PantryTab`, reusing the `Promise.allSettled` pattern from `TransactionMasterList` to enable bulk Delete and Restock operations.
