## 2024-05-22 - Eat First: Smart Waste Reduction **Insight:** Users struggle to track food expiry dates, leading to waste and guilt.

Empower the AI to see expiry dates and prioritize "at-risk" ingredients. Visual indicators in the pantry ("Expiring Soon") nudges the user, and a "Reduce Waste" toggle in the meal planner turns the AI into a zero-waste chef.
