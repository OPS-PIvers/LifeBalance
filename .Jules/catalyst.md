## 2024-05-22 - Export Utilities Found **Discovery:** Found `utils/exportUtils.ts` containing `generateCsvExport` and `generateJsonBackup` functions that were underutilized. **Opportunity:** Easily implemented a "Export filtered view" feature in `TransactionMasterList` by connecting the filtered data state to this utility. This pattern can be replicated for other lists (e.g., Habits, ToDos).

## 2025-05-15 - Budget Calendar Enhancement **Discovery:** The `BudgetCalendar` modal lacked a date picker, forcing users to delete and recreate events to move them. It also lacked a way to duplicate recurring or one-off events. **Opportunity:** Adding a simple Date Picker and Duplicate button to the existing modal unlocks "Move Event" and "Clone as Template" workflows with minimal code.
