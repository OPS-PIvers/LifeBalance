## 2025-02-28 - Meal Plan Copy Feature **Discovery:** The `MealPlanItem` model is simple and flexible, allowing duplicates. The `FirebaseHouseholdContext` makes `addMealPlanItem` easily accessible. **Opportunity:** Implementing a "Copy Week" feature was extremely straightforward by just mapping dates. This pattern (Copy Previous Period) could be applied to Budget Buckets too (though buckets usually carry over, but maybe for resetting manual allocations?).
