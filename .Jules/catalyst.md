## 2024-05-22 - Export Utilities Found **Discovery:** Found `utils/exportUtils.ts` containing `generateCsvExport` and `generateJsonBackup` functions that were underutilized. **Opportunity:** Easily implemented a "Export filtered view" feature in `TransactionMasterList` by connecting the filtered data state to this utility. This pattern can be replicated for other lists (e.g., Habits, ToDos).

## 2025-05-15 - Budget Calendar Enhancement **Discovery:** The `BudgetCalendar` modal lacked a date picker, forcing users to delete and recreate events to move them. It also lacked a way to duplicate recurring or one-off events. **Opportunity:** Adding a simple Date Picker and Duplicate button to the existing modal unlocks "Move Event" and "Clone as Template" workflows with minimal code.

## 2025-05-20 - Batch Transaction Management **Discovery:** Transaction management was strictly one-by-one, despite `FirebaseHouseholdContext` supporting atomic updates. Users importing bank statements (via CSV or AI) likely face a "cleanup debt" requiring bulk categorization. **Opportunity:** Implemented a "Batch Selection Mode" in `TransactionMasterList` using `Promise.allSettled` to execute parallel updates. This pattern unlocks bulk workflows for other lists like ToDos (Batch Complete) or Pantry (Batch Delete).

## 2025-06-03 - Habits CSV Export **Discovery:** The existing `generateCsvExport` utility in `utils/exportUtils.ts` is robust and easily reusable for other data models like Habits. **Opportunity:** Enabled "Export Habits" feature with <50 lines of code by transforming the `Habit[]` structure to flat objects, providing high user value (data portability) with minimal effort.

## 2025-06-15 - Habit Duplication **Discovery:** The `addHabit` function in `FirebaseHouseholdContext` accepts a partial habit object, and the `HabitCard` component has an extensible context menu. **Opportunity:** Implemented "Duplicate Habit" by creating a client-side clone of the habit, resetting progress metrics (count, streak), and passing it to the existing creation logic. This unlocks rapid habit template creation with zero backend changes.
