# LifeBalance

LifeBalance is a comprehensive household management application designed to gamify personal finance and habit tracking. Built as a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA), it combines real-time financial tracking with a robust habit-building system to help users achieve a balanced lifestyle.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 💰 Financial Management
- **"Safe-to-Spend" Metric**: A real-time calculation of your true disposable income, accounting for unpaid bills, budget limits, and pending transactions.
- **Pay Period Budgeting**: Automatically aligns your budget buckets and spending tracking with your paycheck cycle.
- **Transaction Tracking**: Real-time syncing of transactions with automatic categorization.
- **AI Receipt Scanning**: Uses Google Gemini to parse receipts and bank statements for easy data entry.
- **Recurring Expenses**: Calendar-based bill tracking with recurring logic.

### 🎮 Gamified Habits
- **Habit Tracking**: Track daily and weekly habits with customizable scoring (threshold vs. incremental).
- **Streak System**: Earn multipliers for consistency (1.5x for 3-6 days, 2.0x for 7+ days).
- **Freeze Bank**: Earn "Freeze Tokens" to patch missed days and maintain streaks.
- **Challenges & Yearly Goals**: Set long-term targets and track progress over time.
- **Rewards**: Redeem points for real-world rewards defined by the household.

### 🏠 Household Sync
- **Real-time Collaboration**: All data syncs instantly across devices using Firebase Firestore.
- **Shared Habits & Goals**: Participate in challenges together with household members.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OPS-PIvers/LifeBalance.git
    cd LifeBalance
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *Note: We use `legacy-peer-deps` due to some React 19 compatibility details.*
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

### Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Firebase and Gemini credentials.

> **Note:** The values below (e.g., `your_api_key`, `your_project_id`) are placeholders. You must replace them with your actual Firebase and Gemini API keys.

```env
# Firebase Configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id

# Google Gemini API (Required for AI features)
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### Running Locally

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the app at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in your terminal).

## 🏗 Architecture & Core Concepts

### State Management (`FirebaseHouseholdContext`)
The application relies on a single, powerful context (`contexts/FirebaseHouseholdContext.tsx`) that acts as the "brain". It subscribes to multiple Firestore collections (accounts, transactions, habits, etc.) and provides a unified state to the entire app. It also handles business logic actions like `addTransaction` or `toggleHabit`.

### The "Safe-to-Spend" Formula
This is the application's "God Metric", located in `utils/safeToSpendCalculator.ts`. It ensures users never overspend by calculating:
```
Safe-to-Spend = (Checking Balance)
              - (Unpaid Bills due this month)
              - (Adjusted Bucket Liabilities)

Where:
Checking Balance      = Sum of all checking account balances (excludes savings/credit)
Unpaid Bills          = Bills due this month that aren't covered by budget buckets
Bucket Liabilities    = Sum of remaining limits across all budget buckets
Pending Spend         = Sum of pending_review transactions
Adjusted Bucket Liabilities = max(0, Bucket Liabilities - Pending Spend)
```

**Note:** Bills are automatically excluded from the calculation if they match a budget bucket name to avoid double-counting liabilities.

### Routing
The app uses `HashRouter` (e.g., `/#/dashboard`) instead of `BrowserRouter`. This is a deliberate choice to ensure compatibility with simple static hosting environments (like Firebase Hosting) without requiring complex server-side rewrite rules.
